# Motion-Sensored-Light-System-Through-Arduino
This project implements a motion-activated lighting system using Arduino and a PIR (Passive Infrared) sensor. The system automatically turns on the light when motion is detected in its vicinity and turns it off after a preset time if no further motion is detected, providing energy-efficient automation for rooms, corridors, or outdoor areas.
